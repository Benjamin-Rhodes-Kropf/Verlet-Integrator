## Introduction to my Unity Verlet-Integrator with ODE Integration

This Unity project is a Verlet integrator implementation with Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) integration. Verlet integration is a numerical method used to integrate Newton's equations of motion,ODE (Ordinary Differential Equations)integration is used for solving ordinary differential equations.

## Quick Peak!
- you can use the simulator here!

## Features

- Verlet Integration for physics simulation
- Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) integration for accurate calculations
- Customizable parameters for simulation precision and number of simultaneous runs
- Visualize Thomsom Strange Attractor
- Visualize Lorenze Attractor

## Installation
1. Clone this repository or download the project as a ZIP file.
2. Open the project in Unity.
3. Open the 'main' scene you want to work with.

## Usage
To use the Verlet integrator with ODE integration in your Unity project, follow these steps:
1. Use the UI to set diffrent intitalization parameters
2. Run the scene, and the GameObject will be simulated using the Verlet integrator with ODE integration.
3. Hit space to switch between particle views once playing.
4. change the speed paramter to increase simulation accuracy.
